<h2>Pancetta: providing the perfect salty hit for your carbonara dish, pancetta acts as a shortcut to umami deliciousness. If you don't have pancetta, you can certainly use bacon. For a vegetarian version, you can sprinkle your pasta with 'bacon bits' instead, which are generally made from soy-based ingredients (just check the packet!) or use some rinsed capers for a salty addition.</h2>

<h2>Eggs: Not silky carbonara sauce would be complete without eggs, which also bring added protein to your dish. Though this may not be a traditional carbonara, the eggs still play an important role.</h2>

<h2>Thickened cream: our shortcut to getting this meal on the table in next-to-no-time, thickened cream bolsters the sauce and creates a luscious, rich sauce.</h2>

<h2>Parmesan: sharp, tasty parmesan cheese brings extra cheesy goodness to the table. We suggest adding some to the creamy carbonara sauce, and reserving extra to sprinkle on your bowl of pasta at the end (alongside parsley, if you're using it). Vegetarians can also look for vegetarian-friendly parmesan in supermarkets.</h2>
